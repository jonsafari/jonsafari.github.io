  <h1>Research Collaboration using Git</h1>

  <a name="git"><br/><br/>
  <div class="section">
	  <h2>Git</h2>
	  Git is a popular software for version control and collaboration.
	  It tracks changes and helps you synchronize files across multiple computers.
	  Using branches it's easy to try out crazy experimental changes and see if they work out.
	  <p>
	  If you don't know how to use it, well, now's a good time to learn!
	  Here are some useful links to help you learn:
	  <ul>
		  <li><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git Book</a> - An excellent free book in multiple formats, translated into many languages</li>
		  <li><a href="http://git-scm.com/doc">Official Documentation</a>, including videos</li>
		  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Wikipedia Overview</a></li>
		  <li><a href="https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf">Git Cheatsheet</a></li>
		  <li><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Git/Introduction">Wikibooks intro</a></li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>
	  In addition to having your Git repository (repo) on your own computer, you can have your repo hosted on several different sites, including Github, Bitbucket, and Gitlab.
	  You can synchronize between the repo on your computer and on a third-party site.
	  Since your Git repo contains a full history, it's not very important (technologically) which website, if any, you use.
	  They each have pluses and minuses.
  </div>

  <a name="public_repos">
  <div class="section">
	  <h2>Public Code</h2>
	  <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> is a very popular site to share your software code.
	  Think of it as a social network for programmers.
	  You can have an unlimited number of <i>public</i> Git repositories, but you must pay for any <i>private</i> repos.
	  <p>
	  You can create a repo called <tt><i>yourusername</i>.github.io</tt> , and put web pages in that repo.
	  It will then be accessible as <tt>http://<i>yourusername</i>.github.io</tt>
	  Each software repo of yours can also have an <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually">accompanying website</a>, using a new branch called <tt>gh-pages</tt>.
	  The project's website will then be <tt>http://<i>yourusername</i>.github.io/<i>projectname</i></tt>
  </div>

  <a name="private_repos">
  <div class="section">
	  <h2>Private Paper and Experimental Results</h2>
	  Both <a href="https://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a> and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com">Gitlab</a> allow you to have unlimited free <i>private</i> repos.
        Bitbucket is more popular, but limits the number of people you can share your <i>private</i> repos to 5 people, then you must pay.  Gitlab has no such restrictions, but it less popular.
		<p>
        For example, let's say that your username is <tt>myusername</tt>, your repo is named <tt>lm-paper</tt> and you have a collaborator named Bob, who has a Bitbucket ID of <tt>bobusername</tt> :
		<ol>
			<li>First send an invitation of your private repo to your collaborator(s) (see top-right box "Invite users to this repo").  Then have them also share their fork back with you.  In your own repo, type:</li>
			<li><tt>git remote add bob https://myusername@bitbucket.org/bobusername/lm-paper.git</tt></li>
			<li><tt>git remote -v</tt></li>
			<li><tt>git fetch bob</tt></li>
			<li><tt>git merge bob/master</tt></li>
			<li><tt>git push</tt></li>
		</ol>
  </div>

  <a name="readme">
  <div class="section">
	  <h2>Readme Files</h2>
	  Your Git repo should always include two files: <tt>README.md</tt> and <tt>LICENSE.txt</tt> .
	  <p>
	  The <tt>README.md</tt> file gives an overview of your Git project, including the software name, how to install/compile, command-line usage, copyright, etc.
	  The <tt>.md</tt> suffix indicates that it is in the Markdown format, which is like plaintext, but includes some simple additions to make it look nice in your web browser.  Here is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Wikipedia article on Markdown</a>
	  <p>
	  The <tt>LICENSE.txt</tt> file tells others how they can use your software.
	  If you don't specify a license, then you're not granting the right for others to use your code.
	  Consider using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software#Licensing">Free</a> software license to encourage others to use and build upon your software.
  </div>

  <a name="large_files">
  <div class="section">
	  <h2>Large Data Files</h2>
	  Really large data files should not be in a Git repo.
	  Instead, you can use related tools like <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com">Git-LFS</a> or <a href="http://www.git-annex.org">Git-Annex</a>.
	  These tools will <i>track</i> changes to the file, but they won't <i>store</i> the file within the Git repo itself.
	  The Git repo will store the fact that a given large data file has changed, and help you to easily synchronize data changes across computers.
